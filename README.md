Practice pulling data from API's and building an interface for it.

I wanted to do a jobsearch project but could not find a good user-friendly API for it. Decided to use an xkcd comic API instead.

This just displays 20 random comic titles and allows you to click to view each one. If you find one you like, you can enter the comic number at the bottom and save it to the favorites part in the bottom section.
